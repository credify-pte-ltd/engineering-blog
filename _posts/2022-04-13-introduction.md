## Credify's products

The world is rapidly shifting all aspects of life and activity into online ecosystems. In SEA alone, smartphone proliferation rates outpace bank account holdings by a wide margin, and yet access to fair credit and insurance remains a big problem, as these very traditional industries struggle to keep pace with the new digital trends. With 2.5 billion people around the globe lacking traditional credit scores, yet generating more and more relevant information in the form of alternative data as they utilize digital native services, we have an opportunity to leverage this data to empower the masses with greater financial choices at their very point of need. This is the essence of "embedded finance" and this is exactly what we are innovating at Credify.

We offer a product, **serviceX**, to unleash the power of embedded finance. 

serviceX enables digital ecosystem operators to offer attractive services provided by third parties, built on top of our universal identity platform. Example services are BNPL (Buy Now, Pay Later) Gateway, integrated banking, micro insurance, etc.

### Services on serviceX

As serviceX works as a hub that offers services provided by our partners, we have several use cases for various business. Here are our services available on our platform.

#### 1 - Cash loan

_Markets_ (e.g. E-Commerce App) can offer an instant loan through serviceX. Users on their platform will be presented with eligible offers and apply for them in that context without going outside of this platform. The ordinary ads require them to go to a browser or even App Store to download a new app! This application for the loan will take advantage of data managed by this Market, so the users will not have to experience the tedious onboarding step as it is.

#### 2 - Insurance

_Markets_ (e.g. House cleaning app) can offer house insurance to their end-users based on their transaction history or their loyalty to the platform. This insurance purchase will be completed inside the platforms.

#### 3 - BNPL Gateway

_Markets_ can place "Pay with Credify" on their checkout page and they can enable their users to pay with BNPL. We work with multiple financial institutions to deliver BNPL options to users on the Markets. They can select whichever financial institution that offers the best terms to them.


### Business model

We have been focused on the Vietnam market about serviceX sales.

We offer serviceX as SaaS, so we don't charge the onboarding but charge only for the actual usage. In principle, we take a certain percentage of generated value (the following diagram says 30% as an example).

For example, *Service Providers* (B) utilize serviceX to offer products and services (e.g. cash loan, insurance) to users in *Markets* (A), paying a flat fee to *Markets* for access to their users (placement fee) and a success fee in case of successful user acquisition. We will take 30% of this success fee.

On the other hand, in the case of the BNPL Gateway, *Markets* (B) will have their users enjoy BNPL, and *Service Providers (Financial Institutes behind the BNPL Gateway)* (A) will receive a fee from *Markets* (B) as MDR (Merchant Discount Rate). We will take a certain percentage of this MDR.
